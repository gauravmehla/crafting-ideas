<h1 align="center"> A platform to share and grow your ideas </h1>

<h1 align="center"> Idea ðŸ’¡</h1>

Ideas can change the world. Although a lot of people put too much value into them. Ideas without implementation are nothing. Projects like [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) do an amazing job at helping an idea grow up and become a thing.

Some ideas don't need a kickstarter though. I want to create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) like service that would allow users to showcase what ideas they have.

It would have 'channels' or 'communities' where people can share their ideas in a 'tweet like' manner. Other people can join in and ask how they can help and thus ideas actully have more chance at becoming a 'thing'.

There will also be a way to privately track and catalogue one own's ideas that you don't want to yet share with the world.

Here is one such idea. This idea is nothing though until someone actually builts and makes it a 'thing'. This platform should minimse the time that it takes from getting a raw idea out into the world and seeing it grow.

<h1 align="center"> Implementation ðŸš€</h1>

I will probably try to use Meteor to get the first MVP our as soon as possible. Since this platform is essentially a social network for sharing and building on ideas together, it needs traction to actually be of any use. If there are no people, there is no value in the product. 


<h1 align="center"> Features </h1>

- ability to create a profile (similar to twitter)
- aside from profile picture and short bio of oneself, user will have both
  a private and public list of ideas he is working on
- there will be two forms of communication 
    - private messages between users
    - and public sharing of ideas in a tweet like manner
- the main difference between this website and twitter is that this website
  should purely focus on nurturing of ideas by helping people find help they
  need or discuss and expand their ideas with other people
- ideas can be tagged with a # 
    - i.e. a person has an idea to create an alfred workflow
    - he can say publically 'I want to make an alfred workflow that searches
      twitter with autosuggestions #alfred'
- from there he can either publish it publically and let all see his idea and
  offer help
    - or he can publish it privately and it will saved in user's private log of
      ideas with the date when the idea was written down
- if user chooses to share it publically, it will sent in a format similar to
  a tweet (and he can attach a link to the post like a github link) however there will be few options
    - such as offering help
- there will be powerful search functionality that would allow people to search
  for other people's ideas that they can give their hand in making together
