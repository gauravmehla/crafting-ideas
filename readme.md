# Idea ðŸ’¡

Ideas can change the world. Although a lot of people put too much value into them. Ideas without implementation are nothing. Projects like [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) do an amazing job at helping an idea grow up and become a thing.

Some ideas don't need a kickstarter though. I want to create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) like service that would allow users to showcase what ideas they have.

It would have 'channels' or 'communities' where people can share their ideas in a 'tweet like' manner. Other people can join in and ask how they can help and thus ideas actully have more chance at becoming a 'thing'.

There will also be a way to privately track and catalogue one own's ideas that you don't want to yet share with the world.

Here is one such idea. This idea is nothing though until someone actually builts and makes it a 'thing'. This platform should minimse the time that it takes from getting a raw idea out into the world and seeing it grow.
